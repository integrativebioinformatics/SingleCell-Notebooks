## **Are you familiar with Jupyter Notebooks?**

Jupyter Notebooks are an interactive tool that combines executable code, explanatory text, visualizations, and other elements into a single document. Widely used in data science, machine learning, and computational analysis, they support multiple programming languages, with Python being the most popular. Their intuitive interface simplifies data exploration, experiments, and real-time documentation.
Here, we have text cells and code cells serve distinct purposes for organizing and presenting content within notebooks:

**Text Cells**
* These are used for adding explanations, descriptions, and formatting using Markdown or HTML. 
* You can insert headings, lists, links, equations, and other elements to document your work and make it more comprehensible (for you and other people who want to use them). 

Add a Text Cell:
1. Click the + Text button in the top toolbar.
2. Enter your text in the cell using Markdown for formatting (e.g., # for headings, ** for bold text, * for italics).
3. Click outside the cell or press Shift + Enter to render the formatted text.

## Jupyter Cells

**Code Cells** 
* These are used to write and execute programming code, primarily in Python.
* They allow you to test algorithms, manipulate data, and create visualizations, with outputs displayed directly below the executed code.

Add a Code Cell:
1. click the + Code button at the top toolbar of the notebook to insert a code cell below the active one.
2. Enter your code in the cell and press *Shift + Enter* to execute it.

```python
# Teste de c√≥digo Python
test = 4
print(test)
```

Here I can *write* **beautiful** texts

## **Notes:**

**1:** If you want to see the webpages/videos inside this notebook, you need to add this extension:

# **Google Colaboratory**

Google Colab is a free cloud-based platform that allows you to create, run, and share Jupyter notebooks directly in your browser. It supports languages like Python and provides access to powerful computational resources such as GPUs and TPUs, making it ideal for machine learning and data science tasks. 

Additionally, it integrates with Google Drive, enabling easy storage and real-time collaboration.

# **Exploring Single-Cell RNA-seq repositories**

In this activity, we will explore online repositories and tools for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis. We will navigate through various databases, including the Single Cell Expression Atlas (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/home), Human Cell Atlas Data Portal (https://data.humancellatlas.org/), CELLXGENE (https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/), SRA (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), (https://panglaodb.se/), CellType (https://celltype.info/), and CellTypist (https://www.celltypist.org/), to discover and explore single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Through this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to access, visualize, and interpret single-cell RNA-seq data using online resources.

*Objectives:*

- Explore single-cell RNA-seq data repositories and tools
- Learn how to access and visualize single-cell RNA-seq data
- Understand how to interpret single-cell RNA-seq data

*Note:* This activity is designed to be completed in a self-paced manner, and you can work through the exercises at your own speed.
